# Iron Age Population Sources for Central European and Hungarian G25 Ancestry Modeling

This repository provides a curated source list of **Iron Age populations** relevant for ancestry modeling using Vahaduo G25 calculators. The dataset is specifically designed for individuals of **modern Central European and Hungarian ancestry**, aiming to provide a fuller picture of the plausible genetic background for these populations.

It includes both:
- **Locally established Iron Age groups** native to the Carpathian Basin, such as **Western Scythians** and **Celtic La Tène cultures** and
- **Iron Age precursors** of later migration-period groups like the **Sarmatians, Huns, Avars** and **Hungarian Conquerors**.

To further enhance the model, the list also incorporates relevant **southern and eastern populations** for individuals who may have **partial Jewish or Mediterranean ancestry**, especially those with roots extending beyond the modern borders of Hungary.

## Background

The dataset includes population averages derived from the scaled `Global25_PCA_pop_averages` file published by Vahaduo. This list emphasizes historically and genetically relevant Iron Age groups from:

- Central Europe (Celtic La Tène and Western Scythian cultures)
- Inner Eurasia and Siberia (Saka, Sarmatian, Sargat culture, Xiongnu, Xianbei)
- Peripheral but contextually useful southern and eastern populations (Illyrians, Thracians, Urartians, Archaic Greeks, Canaanites etc.)

This model is especially suited for individuals interested in ancient Hungarian and other Central European ancestry and is optimized to work in Vahaduo's G25 single and multi calculators.

## Notable Inclusions

- **Core Iron Age populations of the Carpathian Basin**: Celtic La Tène (Austria, Czechia, Hungary, Slovakia) and Western Scythians
- **Migration-relevant Iron Age populations**: Sarmatians, Saka, Sargat (Scytho-Siberian), Xiongnu, Xianbei, Tarim Basin samples, Mansi/Khanty (Ugric proxies)
- **Peripheral Iron Age groups** for broader ancestry: Illyrians, Thracians, Paeonians
- **Southern and Near Eastern samples**: Canaanites, Archaic Greeks, Roman Republic individuals – useful for identifying low-level Near Eastern or Mediterranean ancestry

## conq_asia_core1 Context

A 2022 archaeogenetic study modeled the ancestry of the Hungarian Conquerors (labelled "Conq_Asia_Core1") using a proximal model as follows:

- 50% Mansi
- 35% Sarmatian
- 15% Xiongnu

Due to the absence of Iron Age genomes for Mansi populations, the study used a **distal model** based on:

- 48% Mezhovskaya culture
- 44% Nganasan
- 8% Botai culture

The populations included here were selected to approximate those components as closely as possible with available Iron Age data.

## Use

This dataset is designed for use with the [Vahaduo G25 calculators](https://vahaduo.github.io/), which allow users to input their own G25 coordinates and test against these population references.
